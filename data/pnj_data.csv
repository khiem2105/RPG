0;0;"villager_hunting_wolves.png";0;"An adventurer here, what a pleasure! I have a mission for you: I need Worg Skins, so my wife will make coats from them for my family this winter.
However, I don't even know how to fight against humans, so it would be difficult for me to collect those Skins. Could you do it for me please?
Don't worry, you will be rewarded: my grandfather died a long time ago, but recently I remembered that he gave me as a legacy this Sun Wand.
I don't think I will do anything with it, so it is better that if it goes to someone which needs it.";"It is not enough:
we are eight in the same house, so we need one Skin per person.";"That is perfect: with those Skins, we are ready to
face winter! Thank you adventurer, you saved us! I give you this object, inherited from my grandfather: 
I know that you will use it well, and I am sure that grandpa would agree."
0;1;"young_adventurer.png";1;"Another person ! I'm saved ! Me and my friend are young and unexperimented adventurers.
Sadly, too much unexperimented : my friend was killed by a pack of Wolves !
I wished to avenge him, but they are too strong and numerous for me.


I don't care about money : I'll offer you everything I obtained in this dungeon.
Just avenge my friend please !";"You didn't kill all of them: I can always hear them roaring !

I didn't sleep since the day my friend died, because I hear this horrible sound while trying to sleep... They follow me in my nightmares... They are in my head!
AAAAAAAAAH! *it looks like he has an anxiety attack*";"You did, it's marvellous! For me, this day is when my journey as an adventurer ends:
I will come back to my parent's farm and I will help them. As I said, I don't care about money: I give you everything we obtained in this dungeon, as a reward.
I would never thank you as much as I should. If you still want being an adventurer, may the odds be ever in your favor!"
1;0;"afraid_of_minotaures.jpg";2;"Hero ! I'm glad to see you ! I came here by accident but I cannot leave :
I'm afraid of Minotaures !


Could you kill some of them please?
It would be easier for me to leave.
You'll be rewarded of course!";"Please help me! 
Kill some Minautores so I will be able to move and leave!";"Thank you hero! The area around is now safer!
Here is your reward: you deserved it!"
1;1;"wizard.jpg";3;"Greetings, noble fighter ! A client commanded me a potion.
It is almost up, but I miss one ingredient ! I hoped that you could help me. Don't worry, there is nothing dangerous...


I need you to kill Minotaures and bring me back their foots.
Do you accept ?";"Why are you still there, you lazybones! 
It's not enough, go back and bring me more!";"Ah, finally you completed your quest! I have enough feet to prepare many potions now.
Well done, I was sure that you would die! A promise is a promise: your gold account will thank me."
2;0;"blacksmith.png";4;"Oh, greetings warrior! I have lost my unique hammer, I think I left it in a container, in this dungeon! 
Can you bring it back to me please?";"I have forgotten to prevent you: I have also lost the key of this container!
I have seen a Goblin walking with it. Just kill him and you will be able to open the container!";"Thank you foreigner!
With your help, I found my hammer! In recognition for that, I offer you a hammer!
*He sees someone else* Hey you there! I have lost my hammer!"
2;1;"swindler.png";5;"Hello foreigner! Are you interested by a quest? And moreover, by a huge treasure? Let me narrate you a story which happened here.
Few weeks ago, a king and his father-in-law came here to search a treasure protected by Goblins.
Nonetheless, as they were going to leave the dungeon, one of them dropped off the bag where the treasure was and he forgot it!
Sadly, Goblins got back the treasure, so if you want it, you will have to kill them.
Do you accept?";"You didn't find it? It's not a surprise: 
the two people I talked you about came back to recover the bag, but neither did they.";"Actually, Goblins did not have the bag: I did. Indeed, I found it by chance, however I could not leave because of the great number of Goblins.
I needed you to kill them, so I can leave: thank you hero! And, here is the bag: don't forget it!"
3;0;"bard.jpg";6;"What a nice surprise: an adventurer! You probably don't know who I am: 
my name is not important, I am only a bard who is not very popular...

*he continues talking during a long time* 

... and I understood that it was because the stories I narrated were not very interesting,
so I came here hoping to meet a hero and see him while he is fighting. Moreover, I am always looking for having new
instruments, and I think that some Skeleton bones would be a quite good material for that. So could you bring me back
some of them please? I will offer you this item I found.";"It is not enough hero: I need more bones.
My future public want me to innovate !";"That's perfect, I have everything I need. Thank you hero, I knew that I could trust you!
For your efforts, I want you to take this: it would be more helpful for you than for me.


And it's not all: while you were fighting, I wrote my new song! It talks about you, so you will be the first one to hear it:
*The bard begins singing with his strident voice*"
3;1;"adventurer.jpg";7;"Hero! I need your help! I came in this dungeon because I was in search of a treasure map: I found a parchment,
but before I could even see what was written on, I was attacked by wolves! Injuried by them, I was only able to fly,
but the parchment has been ripped! Please help me, find all pieces of parchment, and I will reward you with this Moon Wand!
According to what I heard about it, two twin wands were created: the Sun and the Moon ones. Each of them is powerful,
but when they are gathered, it gives incredible skills to his owner! It can be false of course, but I don't know anything about magic,
so I cannot say. Are you interested in?";"Please hero, find all the pieces: 
I came here just to find this map, so help me!";"Unbelievable, you collected all of the pieces! Now let's gather them, so we will be able to read the parchment.

'ine, K g', 'amin, r ha', 'zo, B nk yo', 'Al vin', 'hie pla', 'En tha', 'enj u fo', 'avi', 'ico', 'm, N yed!', 'las ier', 'and X'...
Give me time please: it is not easy to reassembly the parchment!

*After a few moments....*
It is done! I can read what is written:


...'Enzo, Benjamin, Aline, Khiem, Nicolas and Xavier thank you for having played!'...


Well, sadly there is nothing interesting. Thank you anyway: as promised you can have this Moon Wand."
